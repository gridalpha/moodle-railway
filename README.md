# Moodle on Railway

A thin, Railway-specific layer over [`erseco/alpine-moodle`](https://github.com/erseco/alpine-moodle)
(nginx + PHP-FPM 8.3 + runit, with Moodle's cron supervised in the same
container). The upstream image is configured entirely by environment variables;
this repository exists only for the four things a variable cannot express.

## What this layer adds

| | Why |
|---|---|
| `railway-entrypoint.sh` | Railway mounts volumes root-owned and the image runs as `nobody`, so Moodle cannot create its dataroot. Ownership is taken as root, then `su-exec` drops back to `nobody` before anything Moodle owns runs. |
| Baked Composer dependencies | Moodle 5.1+ has real runtime dependencies, and the image resolves them on every boot. Doing it in a build layer turns a multi-minute, network-dependent start into a no-op. |
| `50-railway.sh` | Sets `$CFG->getremoteaddrconf` and `$CFG->reverseproxyignore` so Moodle reads the real client address from behind Railway's edge instead of the edge itself. |
| `zz-railway.ini`, `pm.max_children`, paced cron | The image ships opcache untuned, `pm.max_children=100` sized for a host rather than a container quota, and a cron loop that restarts as fast as runit allows. |

## Services

| Service | Public | Port | Volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| `moodle` (this repo) | yes | 8080 | `/var/www/moodledata` |
| Postgres | no | 5432 | managed |
| Redis | no | 6379 | managed |
| `mailpit` | yes (basic auth) | 8025 | `/data` |

Moodle's cron needs the same filesystem as the web tier, and Railway volumes are
strictly one-to-one with a service, so cron runs inside this container rather
than as a separate service.

## Environment variables

Everything the upstream image reads still applies —
see <https://erseco.github.io/alpine-moodle/environment-variables/>. The ones
that matter on Railway:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `SITE_URL` | `https://${{RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN}}` — this becomes `$CFG->wwwroot` on first boot |
| `SSLPROXY` | `true` — the edge terminates TLS |
| `DB_*` | references to the managed Postgres service |
| `REDIS_HOST` / `REDIS_PASSWORD` | managed Redis; enables Moodle's Redis session handler and application cache |
| `SMTP_*` | Mailpit on the private network |
| `MOODLE_USERNAME` / `MOODLE_PASSWORD` / `MOODLE_EMAIL` | the site administrator, re-applied on every boot |
| `PHP_FPM_MAX_CHILDREN` | worker cap, default `16` |
| `MOODLE_CRON_INTERVAL` | seconds between cron runs, default `60` |

`MOODLE_SITENAME` and `MOODLE_PASSWORD` are passed to Moodle's CLI installer
unquoted by the upstream image, so neither may contain spaces or shell
metacharacters.

Because the administrator credentials are re-applied from the environment on
every boot, change them by editing these variables — a password changed in
Moodle's own UI is reverted by the next deployment.

## Licence

Moodle is GPL-3.0-or-later; the upstream image is MIT. This layer is MIT.
